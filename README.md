# Azlen's Roam Themes - Updated Cosmonaut

- Side-by-side page view (shift-click to open on side)
- Minimal aesthetic
- Overlay pages on graph view
- Snazzy search bar
- Custom styles for most components

UPDATE: Separated duplicate code into `core.css`

To use, just copy the theme you'd like into [[roam/css]], there is a CSS import to collect `core.css` from this repository which will automatically update to reflect future fixes and updates to the core theme

Or use a single line to import the theme you'd like:
`@import url('https://kylenoble.github.io/roam-themes/cosmonaut.css');`
